## About this Course

Functional Programming is an old paradigm, but one that is relatively new to Java world. In this course we will explore 
how to take advantage of the power that comes with thinking declaratively. What you'll learn:
1. Imperative vs. Declarative Syntax
2. Lambdas & Method References
3. Streams
4. Functional Programming concepts
5. Higher Order Functions and Closures

NOTE: YOU CAN ALWAYS USE CTRL - Q to find out more on highlighted code.

## Teachers Notes
1. Entry 3: A More Functional Loop: 
    1. [Iterable.forEach Javadoc](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Iterable.html#forEach-java.util.function.Consumer-)
    2. [forEach method for iterable](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Iterable.html#forEach-java.util.function.Consumer-)
    with the [definition of Consumer](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/function/Consumer.html).
    A functional interface is an interface with exactly 1 abstract method.
